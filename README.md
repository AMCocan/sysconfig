## About

This project helps with setting up new workstations consistently. Have you changed workstations and discovered inconsistencies in your system setup? Maybe you forgat what theme you used in your code editor or the name of a software that you relied on. This is a personal GitBook that contains the preferances and system configurations of [AMCocan's](https://github.com/amcocan) workstations.
